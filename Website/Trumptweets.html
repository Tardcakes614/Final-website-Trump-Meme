          <p style="font-size: 300%">   Trump is a mater at the art of tweeting, he truly understands how to troll. Many people wondered what was the purpose of his offensive tweets were; together we are going to dissect how Trump trolled his way into the white house. Trolls don’t just say offensive things because it is funny, the true purpose is to pit two types of people against each other. On one hand you have the trolls who say the hurtful things, they don’t always believe in what they are saying, but they do it to "trigger" the keyboard SJW. A keyboard SJW is someone who instead of ignoring the trolls, they directly confront them. This makes them come across as self righteous and arrogant to the average spectator. This election was a lot like this back and forth between the troll and the SJW. Trump would bait Hillary with an offensive comment causing her to go on a tangent about how much better of a person she is then him. However by doing this she calls millions of people Bigots, sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, and so on. However many Trump supporters are just the people the Obama administration ended up hurting. However when you blindly insult a group of people that drives them to the polls. Trump truly understood how fed up blue-collar America was with the PC elitist culture. </p>
