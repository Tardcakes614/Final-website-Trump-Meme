            I am a young, sexy, and smart. My dream is to one day become a profesional meme analyser. This election cycle we all witnessed a true meme lord, his name is Donald J Trump. He was able to meme his way into the white house. He truely has the dankest memes, I was inspored by his memes. Driven by my insatiable thirst for dank memes I began to study the art of the meme. The wise man once said if you want to learn how to meme you must learn from the dankest meme lord. That is why I began my journey to master the art of the meme and one day I will out meme Donald Trump
